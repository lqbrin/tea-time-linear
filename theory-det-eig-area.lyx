\begin_layout Standard
Intuitively, we might think of area as the amount of paint needed in painting
 a particular shape.
 The more paint needed, the larger its area, and the larger its area, the
 more paint needed.
 To have some sense of what is meant by the area of an object, this intuition
 is good enough.
 Larger shapes have larger area while smaller shapes have smaller area,
 and the area of a shape is some measure of this size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Calculating the areas of a shapes (assigning numbers to areas) is another
 story.
 We certainly are not going to require that to find the area of an object
 it needs to be painted and the amount of paint used measured.
 What paint should be used, by whom, and what instrument should do the measuring
? This process would be so imprecise it would lead to a single shape having
 many areas (depending on the paint, the painter, and the measuring device),
 a rather undesirable situation.
 The area of a shape should be uniquely determined.
 A single shape has but a single size, and so it must have but a single
 measure of its size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of area formulas are presented in grammar school.
 The area of a rectangle is its length times width.
 The area of a triangle is one half its base times height.
 The area of a circle is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 times the square of its radius.
 Trapezoids, parallelograms, regular polygons, and unions of such shapes
 have calculable areas.
 Doesn't that pretty much cover it? As you might have imagined by now, the
 answer is no.
 For a simple example, take an arbitrary nonempty overlap between a square
 and circle where neither is the circle contained within the square nor
 is the square contained within the circle.

 Calculus provides a method for calculating its area and hints at the complexity
 of the general question.
 By slicing the shape into smaller and smaller approximating rectangles
 and adding up the areas of those rectangles, the area can be approximated
 more and more accurately.
 The limit of these areas as the widths of the approximating rectangles
 aproaches zero is the area of the overlap.
 If you've taken calculus, that probably reminds you of integration, and
 it should! If you have not taken calculus, that probably sounds rather
 confusing and complicated, and it should! That is really the point.
 It is not an easy matter to calculate area, even of shapes that are easy
 to draw.

 and features an infinitely spiraling appendage.
 The figure on the right is referred to as a twin dragon as it is the union
 of a pair of dragon curves.
 Neither of these figures can be drawn with perfect precision since each
 has infinitely small detail.
 The twin dragon is an example of a self-similar fractal with nonzero area.
 Its boundary (perimeter) is infinitely long and infinitely intricate.
 The more one magnifies the boundary, the more detail is revealed.
 While the snail can be formed by a union of infinitely many nonoverlapping
 triangles in a straightforward way, making its area calculable, the twin
 dragon cannot.
 Even applying calculus to the problem of finding the area of the twin dragon
 is not a straightforward matter.
 Does it even have a calculable area? What does having a calculable area
 mean? Are there sets whose areas are not calculable? These questions can
 be followed deep into measure theory, a branch of analysis far outside
 the reaches of this textbook.

The area of a bounded region of the plane, a shape 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, can be defined as follows.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 be a polygonal region containing 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{R}$
\end_inset

 be a primitive partition of 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 (a finite set of parallelograms and triangles whose interiors do not overlap
 and whose union is 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

).
 Define the norm of a partition, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $||\mathcal{P}_{R}||$
\end_inset

, as the maximum of the areas of the primitives in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{area}(S)=\lim_{||\mathcal{P}_{R}||\to0}\sum_{\substack{p\in\mathcal{P}_{R}\\
p\subseteq S
}
}\text{area}(p)

it hardly makes practical sense to expect to prove the ways linear transformatio

 The following discussion is inherently incomplete this way.
 Certain claims regarding area will necessarily remain unproven.

\begin_layout Standard
In general, the image of a set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is defined as the set of images of all the points in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 That is, if 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T:A\to B$
\end_inset

, then the image of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 under 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $T(S)=\{T(s):s\in S\}$
\end_inset

.
 This definition typical in all of mathematics, not just linear algebra,
 and applies no matter the sets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand how the linear transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}(\mathbf{v})=A\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 affects areas, it is convenient to write 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is a product of elementary matrices, 
\begin_inset Formula $A=E_{p}\cdots E_{2}E_{1}$
\end_inset

, as we have done before assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is invertible (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "par:M-as-a-product"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}(S)=(T_{E_{p}}\circ\cdots\circ T_{E_{2}}\circ T_{E_{1}})(S)$
\end_inset

, if we can understand how linear transformations associated with elementary
 matrices affect area, we have a chance of understanding how general linear
 transformations affect area.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is a row swap matrix, then 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{E}$
\end_inset

 is a reflection about the line 
\begin_inset Formula $y=x$
\end_inset

, so in this case 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{area}(T_{E}(S))=\text{area}(S)$
\end_inset

.
 Reflections do not change areas.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is a row replace matrix, then 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{E}$
\end_inset

 is a shear transformation, and it is a known result of calculus that shear
 transformations do not affect area, so again 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{area}(T_{E}(S))=\text{area}(S)$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is a row scale matrix, then 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{E}$
\end_inset

 scales shapes either horizontally or vertically—not both!—by a factor of
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{area}(T_{E}(S))=|s|\cdot\text{area}(S)$
\end_inset

.
 In every case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{area}(T_{E}(S))=|\det E|\cdot\text{area}(S)$
\end_inset

.
 Remember, the determinant of a row swap matrix is 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

, the determinant of a row replace matrix is 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and the determinant of a row scale matrix with scale factor 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{area}\left(T_{A}(S)\right) & =\text{area}\left((T_{E_{p}}\circ\cdots\circ T_{E_{2}}\circ T_{E_{1}})(S)\right)\\
 & =\text{area}\left(T_{E_{p}}\left(\cdots\left(T_{E_{2}}\left(T_{E_{1}}(S)\right)\right)\cdots\right)\right)\\
 & =|\det E_{p}|\cdots|\det E_{2}|\cdot|\det E_{1}|\cdot\text{area}(S)\\
 & =|\det A|\cdot\text{area}(S).
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is noninvertible, then one of the columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is a multiple of the other, so any linear combination of the columns is
 also a multiple of that column.
 Therefore, the image of any vector, which is a linear combination of the
 columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, is a multiple of that column.
 Thus the image of every vector lies on the line determined by that column,
 giving the image of any shape area zero.
 The entire image is contained within a line.
 Of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $|\det A|=0$
\end_inset

, so again we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{area}(T_{A}(S))=|\det A|\cdot\text{area}(S)$
\end_inset

.

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1},\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2},\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}(\mathbf{v}_{1})=\lambda_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}(\mathbf{v}_{2})=\lambda_{2}\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, if we let 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\{\mathbf{v}_{1}+\alpha\mathbf{v}_{2}:0\leq\alpha\leq1\}$
\end_inset

, the line segment from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}+\mathbf{\mathbf{v}}_{2}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}(S)=\{T_{A}(\mathbf{v}_{1}+\alpha\mathbf{v}_{2}):0\leq\alpha\leq1\}=\{\lambda_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}+\alpha\lambda_{2}\mathbf{v}_{2}:0\leq\alpha\leq1\}$
\end_inset

 is the line segment from 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}(\mathbf{v}_{1})$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}(\mathbf{v}_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Further analysis shows that the image of the parallelogram determined by
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the parallelogram determined by 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}(\mathbf{v}_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}(\mathbf{v}_{2})$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
Letting 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 be the parallelogram determined by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

, we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}$
\end_inset

 scales 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 direction by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

 and in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

 direction by factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the area of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}(P)$
\end_inset

 equals 
\begin_inset Formula $|\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}|$
\end_inset

 times the area of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

.
 Since we have been arguing that linear transformations scale the areas
 of all shapes the same way, we have generally that 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{area}(T_{A}(S))=|\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}|\cdot\text{area}(S)$
\end_inset

 for any shape whose area is measurable.
 With respect to the eigenvectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}$
\end_inset

 is a simple scaling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{area}(T_{A}(S)) & =|\det A|\cdot\text{area}(S)\\
 & \text{and}\\
\text{area}(T_{A}(S)) & =|\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}|\cdot\text{area}(S).
\end{align*}

\end_inset

It must be, then, that 
\begin_inset Formula $|\det A|=|\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}|$
\end_inset

.
 This is true for any 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 matrix including noninvertible ones, but the statement can be made much
 stronger, as in the following theorem.

\noindent
Some but not all parts of the justification of this theorem are straightforward.
 For example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is upper triangular, then the conclusion follows quickly.
 As we have seen, 
\begin_inset Formula $\det A$
\end_inset

 is the product of the entries on the main diagonal.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\det A=\prod_{i=1}^{n}A_{i,i}$
\end_inset

.
 The characteristic equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
0 & =\det(A-\lambda I)\\
 & =\det\left(\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
A_{1,1}-\lambda & \star & \cdots & \star\\
0 & A_{2,2}-\lambda & \cdots & \star\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
0 & 0 & 0 & A_{n,n}-\lambda
\end{array}\right]\right)\\
 & =(A_{1,1}-\lambda)(A_{2,2}-\lambda)\cdots(A_{n,n}-\lambda)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

has solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1,1},A_{2,2},\ldots,A_{n,n}$
\end_inset

, so the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are the entries on the main diagonal of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\prod_{i=1}^{n}A_{i,i}=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 completing the proof for upper triangular matrices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is any matrix, the conclusion follows from two facts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The determinant and eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{-1}AP$
\end_inset

 are the same as the determinant and eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 for any invertible 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For any 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, there is an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{-1}AP$
\end_inset

 is upper triangular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming these facts true for a moment, if 
\begin_inset Formula $U=P^{-1}AP$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\det A=\det U$
\end_inset

 and the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 by fact 1.
 Now if 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is that special matrix such that 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 is upper triangular, as guaranteed to exist by fact 2, then the determinant
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 (which equals the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) and the product of the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 (which equals the product of the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) are both 
\begin_inset Formula $\prod_{i=1}^{n}U_{i,i}$
\end_inset

 and therefore equal.
 This concludes the proof of the theorem for general matrices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Justification of fact 2 takes a bit of work (see crumpet 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "dig:triangularization"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), but fact 1 can be justified in reasonably short order.
 To show that the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{-1}AP$
\end_inset

 are the same as the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is a matter of a calculation.
 For any value 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\det(P^{-1}AP-\lambda I) & =\det(P^{-1}AP-P^{-1}(\lambda I)P)\\
 & =\det(P^{-1}(A-\lambda I)P)\\
 & =\det(P^{-1})\cdot\dot{\det(A-\lambda I)}\cdot\det P\\
 & =\det(A-\lambda I)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

so the characteristic equations of 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{-1}AP$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are equal making the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{-1}AP$
\end_inset

 equal.

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda,\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and find vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1},\mathbf{u}_{2},\ldots,\mathbf{u}_{n-1}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{v},\mathbf{u}_{1},\mathbf{u}_{2},\ldots,\mathbf{u}_{n-1}\}$
\end_inset

 is linearly independent.
 This set can always be found since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 must have at least one nonzero entry (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

 is not a permissible eigenvector).
 Assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i,1}\neq0$
\end_inset

, we may take 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{v},\mathbf{u}_{1},\mathbf{u}_{2},\ldots,\mathbf{u}_{n-1}\}=\{\mathbf{v}\}\cup\{I_{:,j}:j\neq i\}$
\end_inset

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
\mathbf{v} & \mathbf{u}_{1} & \mathbf{u}_{2} & \cdots & \mathbf{u}_{n-1}\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is invertible (its columns are linearly independent), and
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Q^{-1}AQ & =Q^{-1}A\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
\mathbf{v} & \mathbf{u}_{1} & \mathbf{u}_{2} & \cdots & \mathbf{u}_{n-1}\end{array}\right]\\
 & =\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
Q^{-1}A\mathbf{v} & Q^{-1}A\mathbf{u}_{1} & Q^{-1}A\mathbf{u}_{2} & \cdots & Q^{-1}A\mathbf{u}_{n-1}\end{array}\right]\\
 & =\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
\lambda Q^{-1}\mathbf{v} & Q^{-1}A\mathbf{u}_{1} & Q^{-1}A\mathbf{u}_{2} & \cdots & Q^{-1}A\mathbf{u}_{n-1}\end{array}\right].
\end{align*}

\end_inset

While we cannot say much about 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{-1}A\mathbf{u}_{j}$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, we can say 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda Q^{-1}\mathbf{v}=\lambda I_{:,1}$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{-1}Q=Q^{-1}\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
\mathbf{v} & \mathbf{u}_{1} & \mathbf{u}_{2} & \cdots & \mathbf{u}_{n-1}\end{array}\right]=I$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{-1}$
\end_inset

 times the first column of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 must be the first column of 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

.
 Hence we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q^{-1}AQ=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
\lambda & \star & \star & \star & \star\\
0 & \star & \star & \star & \star\\
0 & \star & \star & \star & \star\\
\vdots & \star & \star & \star & \star\\
0 & \star & \star & \star & \star
\end{array}\right].
\]

\end_inset

By the inductive hypothesis, there is a triangularization of 
\begin_inset Formula $(Q^{-1}AQ)_{\backslash1,1}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 be such that 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{-1}(Q^{-1}AQ)_{\backslash1,1}R$
\end_inset

 is upper triangular, and set 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Q}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & R
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Q}^{-1}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & R^{-1}
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{Q}^{-1}(Q^{-1}AQ)\hat{Q}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & R^{-1}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\lambda & \star\\
0 & (Q^{-1}AQ)_{\backslash1,1}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & R
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

is upper triangular.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $(Q\hat{Q})^{-1}A(Q\hat{Q})$
\end_inset

 is a triangularization of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 This result suffices for our purposes, but the result can be strengthened
 to specify that 
\begin_inset Formula $(Q\hat{Q})$
\end_inset

 have a certain property, a so-called Schur decomposition.

Hence we have two ways to measure the effect of a linear transformation
 on the plane.
 In rough terms, a linear transformation expands or compresses areas by
 a factor equal to the absolute value of the determinant (which is equal
 to the absolute value of the product of the eigenvalues) of its standard
 matrix.
 More precisely a linear transformation expands or compresses areas in the
 direction of each eigenvector by a factor equal to the absolute value of
 the associated eigenvalue.
