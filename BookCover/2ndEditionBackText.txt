Welcome to Tea Time, where mathematics meets imagination. Take a ride through the landscape of linear algebra from basic mechanics through inner product spaces.

Presented in a conversational style with plenty of motivation, illustrations, applications, and theory, this text should be a comfortable read for most beginning mathematicians. Readers and instructors alike will appreciate the numerous detailed exercise solutions accompanying each section.

Examine the distribution of bicycles in the Capital Bikeshare system, model an un-preheated oven baking brownies, reproduce sounds via Fourier series, explore rep-tiles like the one decorating this cover, and more. Read proofs of the rank and nullity theorem, the determinant expansion formula, existence and uniqueness of solutions of linear systems and others.

It's all here in Tea Time Linear Algebra.
