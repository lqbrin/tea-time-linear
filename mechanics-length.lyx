Geometric Interpretation of Vectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One day, my friend Victor took a 5 kilometer drive.
 When Victor told me this I knew just how long his drive was.
 It was 5 kilometers.
 When Victor added that his drive was on a very straight highway headed
 due east, I knew more.
 I knew which way Victor was driving.
 I could imagine tracing out his path on a map by drawing a horizontal arrow
 pointing to the right (eastward) with a length equivalent to 5 kilometers.
 The arrow captures both the direction and length of Victor's drive.
 Vectors can be imagined in the same way.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
5\\
0
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

has a 5 as its first entry and a 0 as its second.
 Thinking of these entries as 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

- and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

- coordinates, the five represents 5 units right (eastward) and the zero
 represents 0 units up (northward).
 In this way, the vector represents both the length and direction of Victor's
 drive, just like the arrow.
 The vector and the arrow can be interpreted to represent the same thing,
 blurring any distinction between them.

\noindent
The vector/arrow represents Victor's displacement, or movement, 5 kilometers
 in the eastward direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice there is no origin on the map.
 This is typical of drawing vectors.
 They are not specified relative to an origin.
 They only represent a change in location, or displacement, starting anywhere.
 A vector represents the locations of two points relative to one another.
 Exactly where those two points lie is not determined by the vector itself.
 Further information is needed to locate the vector.
 In the case of Victor's travel, I needed to know on what road and where
 he was driving to create an accurate picture of his drive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After driving 5 kilometers east, Victor exited the highway and drove 3 kilometer
s southeast (using a road that does not appear on the map).
 When I heard this, I was able to capture this part of Victor's journey
 by the vector
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\\
-\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}
\end{array}\right].
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
And I knew exactly where to put it since it started just where the previous
 leg left off.
 Drawn as an arrow, the vector is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with
 side lengths 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}$
\end_inset

, which by the Pythagorean theorem gives it length 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\left(\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\right)^{2}+\left(\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\right)^{2}}=3$
\end_inset

.
 It has the right length and it points southeast (and starts where the first
 leg leaves off), so it accurately represents the second leg of Victor's
 drive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the crow flies, Victor's total displacement or movement for the drive
 is represented by the sum of the vectors,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
5+\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\\
-\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}
\end{array}\right].
\]

\end_inset

\noindent
Since addition of vectors is commutative, it does not matter which vector
 is plotted first.
 After the pair of displacements, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{c}
5\\
0
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\\
-\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

, Victor's total displacement is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{c}
5+\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\\
-\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 In the diagram, the gray vectors represent 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{c}
5\\
0
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\\
-\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

 and the blue vectors represent 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\\
-\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}
5\\
0
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The five vectors together illustrate the parallelogram rule for vector
 addition.
 The sum of two vectors is a diagonal of the parallelogram determined by
 the two vectors.

\begin_layout Standard
The length of a vector, not surprisingly, is defined by the length of its
 representative arrow.

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Regardless of which direction a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

 points, its length is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{|x|^{2}+|y|^{2}}$
\end_inset

 or simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{x^{2}+y{}^{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 The Pythagorean theorem is helpful in verifying this fact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the dot product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 with itself is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{v}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y
\end{array}\right]^{T}\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y
\end{array}\right]=x^{2}+y^{2}
\]

\end_inset

so the length of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $|\mathbf{v}|$
\end_inset

, can also be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
|\mathbf{v}|=\sqrt{\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{v}}.
\]

\end_inset

In the following diagram, vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 have the same length in one triangle and have different lengths in the
 other.

Vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is congruent to itself and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is congruent to 
\begin_inset Formula $-\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the triangle with sides 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is congruent to the triangle with sides 
\begin_inset Formula $-\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 if and only if angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is congruent to angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 (by the side-angle-side theorem of geometry).
 Hence sides (vectors) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 are congruent if and only if angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is congruent to angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, which happens if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 are perpendicular.
 This dictates something about the dot product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 are perpendicular if and only if
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
|\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}| & =|\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u}|\\
\sqrt{(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u})^{T}(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u})} & =\sqrt{(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u})^{T}(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u})}\\
(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u})^{T}(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}) & =(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u})^{T}(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u})\\
(\mathbf{v}^{T}+\mathbf{u}^{T})(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}) & =(\mathbf{v}^{T}-\mathbf{u}^{T})(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u})\\
\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{u} & =\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{u}\\
\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{v} & =-\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{v}\\
2\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u} & =-2\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{v}\\
2\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u} & =-2\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u}\\
4\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u} & =0\\
\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u} & =0
