Geometric Interpretation of Vectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One day my friend Victor took a 5 kilometer drive.
 When Victor told me this I knew just how long his drive was.
 It was 5 kilometers.
 When Victor added that his drive was on a very straight highway headed
 due east, I knew more.
 I knew which way Victor was driving.
 I could imagine tracing out his path on a map by drawing a horizontal arrow
 pointing to the right (eastward) with a length equivalent to 5 kilometers.
 The arrow captures both the direction and length of Victor's drive.
 Vectors can be imagined in the same way.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
5\\
0
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

has a 5 as its first entry and a 0 as its second.
 Thinking of these entries as 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

- and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

- coordinates, the five represents 5 units right (eastward) and the zero
 represents 0 units up (northward).
 In this way, the vector represents both the length and direction of Victor's
 drive, just like the arrow.
 The vector and the arrow can be interpreted to represent the same thing,
 blurring any distinction between them.

\noindent
The vector/arrow represents Victor's displacement, or movement, 5 kilometers
 in the eastward direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice there is no origin on the map.
 This is typical of drawing vectors.
 They are not specified relative to an origin.
 They only represent a change in location, or displacement, starting anywhere.
 A vector represents the locations of two points relative to one another.
 Exactly where those two points lie is not determined by the vector itself.
 Further information is needed to locate the vector.
 In the case of Victor's travel, I needed to know on what road and where
 he was driving to create an accurate picture of his drive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After driving 5 kilometers east, Victor exited the highway and drove 3 kilometer
s southeast (using a road that does not appear on the map).
 When I heard this, I was able to capture this part of Victor's journey
 by the vector
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\\
-\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}
\end{array}\right].
\]

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
And I knew exactly where to put it since it started just where the previous
 leg left off.
 Drawn as an arrow, the vector is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with
 side lengths 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}$
\end_inset

, which by the Pythagorean theorem gives it length 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\left(\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\right)^{2}+\left(\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\right)^{2}}=3$
\end_inset

.
 It has the right length and it points southeast (and starts where the first
 leg leaves off), so it accurately represents the second leg of Victor's
 drive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the crow flies, Victor's total displacement or movement for the drive
 is represented by the sum of the vectors,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
5\\
0
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\\

5+\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\\
-\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}
\end{array}\right],
\]

\end_inset

the black vector in the diagram.

\begin_layout Standard
Since addition of vectors is commutative, it does not matter which vector
 is plotted first.
 In the diagram, the gray vectors represent 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{c}
5\\
0
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\\
-\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}

\end_inset

 and the blue vectors represent 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\\
-\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}
5\\
0
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 After the pair of displacements, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{c}
5\\
0
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\\
-\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

, Victor's total displacement is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{c}
5+\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}\\
-\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

 no matter which displacement comes first.
 The diagram illustrates the parallelogram rule for vector addition.
 The sum of two vectors is a diagonal of the parallelogram determined by
 the two vectors.

Perpendicularity

\begin_layout Standard
The length of a vector, not surprisingly, is defined by the length of its
 representative arrow.
 A collection of vectors pointing in various directions, including vertical
 and horizontal are shown below.

\noindent
Regardless of which direction the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

 points, its length is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{|x|^{2}+|y|^{2}}$
\end_inset

 or simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{x^{2}+y{}^{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 The Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate lengths of vectors that
 are not horizontal or vertical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coincidentally the dot product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 with itself, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y
\end{array}\right]^{T}\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y
\end{array}\right]=x^{2}+y^{2}
\]

\end_inset

so the length of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 can also be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

.
 This expression has a nice symmetry and is independent of the number of
 entries in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 It could apply to vectors with 3, 8, or 28 entries just as wel as vectors
 with 2 entries.
 Indeed, this is how the length, or magnitude, of a vector is defined for
 any size vector.
 The 
\series bold
length
\series default
 of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, denoted  
\begin_inset Formula $\Vert\mathbf{v}\Vert$
\end_inset

, is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Vert\mathbf{v}\Vert=\sqrt{\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{v}}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the lengths of
 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

.
 By the side-angle-side theorem from geometry the pair of triangles in each
 figure are congruent if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\beta$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 together form a straight angle, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\beta$
\end_inset

 if and only if they are both right angles.
 Consequently the lengths of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 are equal if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 are perpendicular.

\noindent
This observation leads to a very useful property of the dot product, exposed
 by the following calculation.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\Vert\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}\Vert & =\Vert\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u}\Vert\nonumber \\
\sqrt{(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u})^{T}(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u})} & =\sqrt{(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u})^{T}(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u})}\nonumber \\
(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u})^{T}(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}) & =(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u})^{T}(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u})\nonumber \\
(\mathbf{v}^{T}+\mathbf{u}^{T})(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}) & =(\mathbf{v}^{T}-\mathbf{u}^{T})(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u})\nonumber \\
\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{u} & =\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{u}\nonumber \\
\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{v} & =-\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{v}\nonumber \\
2\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u} & =-2\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{v}\nonumber \\
2\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u} & =-2\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u}\nonumber \\
4\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u} & =0\nonumber \\
\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u} & =0\label{eq:orthogonality}
\end{align}

\end_inset

Vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 (with two entries) are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is
 zero! Passing from the seventh equation to the eighth equation depends
 on the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Can you show this is true for any vectors of equal size? Answer on page

\begin_layout Standard
As with the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vert\mathbf{v}\Vert=\sqrt{\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 for length, this calculation is independent of the number of entries in
 the vectors.
 We say that vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 of the same size are 
\series bold
orthogonal
\series default
 if and only if their dot product is zero.
 For vectors with two or three entries this means the vectors are perpendicular.
 As a result, orthogonality is precisely the same as perpendicularity in
 two and three dimensions, and extends the idea to dimensions greater than
 three.

If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 are placed with their tails at the same point, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vert\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v}\Vert$
\end_inset

 is the distance between the heads of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 See the diagram above.
 As such, the distance between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $d(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

, is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vert\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v}\Vert$
\end_inset

.
 Easy to picture in two dimensions, this formula applies to vectors of any
 length again extending a two- and three-dimensional notion to higher dimensions.
